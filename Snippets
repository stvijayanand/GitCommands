Push current code to a different repository
===========================================

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5181845/git-push-existing-repo-to-a-new-and-different-remote-repo-server

cd existing_repo
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/newproject
git push -u origin --all
git push -u origin --tags




ignoring node_modules  
======================
**Stackoverflow**

Since the node_modules directory is already tracked as part of the repository, the .gitignore rule will not apply to it.

You need to untrack the directory from git using

git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m "removing node_modules"
You can run the above 2 in git-bash.

After this, the .gitignore rule will ignore the directory away.

Note that this will remove the directory node_modules from your other repos once you pull the changes in. 
Only the original repo where you made that commit will still have the node_modules folder there.


How to find out what your remote repository is?
===============================================
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4089430/how-can-i-determine-the-url-that-a-local-git-repository-was-originally-cloned-fr/4089452#4089452

If you want only the remote URL, or referential integrity has been broken:

git config --get remote.origin.url
If you require full output or referential integrity is intact:

git remote show origin
When using git clone (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using git remote show will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:

C:\Users\jaredpar\VsVim> git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:jaredpar/VsVim.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:jaredpar/VsVim.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
If you want to use the value in the script, you would use the first command listed in this answer.

For me, this is the easier way (less typing):

$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git (push)
