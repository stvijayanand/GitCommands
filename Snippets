How to clone a specific git branch
==================================
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911109/how-to-clone-a-specific-git-branch/4568323#4568323

git clone -b my-branch git@github.com:user/myproject.git


Push current code to a different repository
===========================================

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5181845/git-push-existing-repo-to-a-new-and-different-remote-repo-server

cd existing_repo
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/newproject
git push -u origin --all
git push -u origin --tags




ignoring node_modules  
======================
**Stackoverflow**

Since the node_modules directory is already tracked as part of the repository, the .gitignore rule will not apply to it.

You need to untrack the directory from git using

git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m "removing node_modules"
You can run the above 2 in git-bash.

After this, the .gitignore rule will ignore the directory away.

Note that this will remove the directory node_modules from your other repos once you pull the changes in. 
Only the original repo where you made that commit will still have the node_modules folder there.


How to find out what your remote repository is?
===============================================
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4089430/how-can-i-determine-the-url-that-a-local-git-repository-was-originally-cloned-fr/4089452#4089452

If you want only the remote URL, or referential integrity has been broken:

git config --get remote.origin.url
If you require full output or referential integrity is intact:

git remote show origin
When using git clone (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using git remote show will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:

C:\Users\jaredpar\VsVim> git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:jaredpar/VsVim.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:jaredpar/VsVim.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
If you want to use the value in the script, you would use the first command listed in this answer.

For me, this is the easier way (less typing):

$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git (push)


Reverting to a previous commit
===============================
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-to-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit)

Temporarily switch to a different commit

If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:

# This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32

Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:

git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32

To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)
Hard delete unpublished commits

If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:

# This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.

If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.
Undo published commits with new commits

On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.

# This will create three separate revert commits:
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes:
git revert a867b4af..0766c053 

# Reverting a merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>

# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
git commit

Discard Local changes
